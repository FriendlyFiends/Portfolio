Welcome to my website!

To navigate from the homepage you can click 'On My Mind' to see the full gallery of articles I archive. 

Within Gallery, you have the options of logging in as an admin:

Username: Admin
Password: Admin

As well as search the archive for all the articles I have in my database. (Consists of the 9 shown articles on the page)

When logged in you have the ablility to add more articles to the webpage. You must add a title, and a description. 

I was unfortunately not able to figure out inserting images to the database, so the file browser currently does not work. 

Thanks!
